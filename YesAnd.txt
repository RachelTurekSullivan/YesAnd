Every 17 years, a giant cicada brood emerges in the Appalachian region. 
In the Summer of 2021, something else emerged in the mountains that changed the world forever.
It was a large dancing kangaroo that was destined to end the cycle of the cicada overlord.

The kangaroo was named Tomithy. He was a large kangaroo. He has magical powers and he could grow a beard in 5 seconds.
Tomithy was afraid of his destiny - he never was one for foreshaddowing.

Tomithy hopped onto the world stage a critical time.  
A worldwide shortage of artificial beard extensions left millions of humans with tragically smooth, baby-like chins.
